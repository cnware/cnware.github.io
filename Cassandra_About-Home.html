      <p> I first became interested in techonology as a young child playing video  games, like pretty much everyone else.
          However when I got a bit older I joined a new computer program, at Town Boys & Girls Club I attended after school.
          It was there where I got exposed to refurbishing computers. Taking old desktops apart dusting them off and installing new operating systems.
          It became something I enjoyed and even went during summers to give a helping hand.
        <br> <br>
          Growing to an adult I have decided to delve into what I truly enjoyed and declared Computer Engineering straight out of high school.
          The journey has been challenging but I always find myself making it to other side and becoming stronger as an individual from it.
